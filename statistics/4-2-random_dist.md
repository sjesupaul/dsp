[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)


>> This exercise explores the uniformity of the random function, where each value in a range has the equal probability of being produced. We can determine this by looking at the probability mass function (PMF) and cumulative distribution function. While the PMF maps a value to its probability, CDF maps a value to its
percentile rank. To visualize these distributions, we can see a [PMF plot here](https://github.com/sjesupaul/dsp/blob/master/statistics/4-2-PMF_Plot.png) and a [CDF plot here](https://github.com/sjesupaul/dsp/blob/master/statistics/4-2-CDF_Plot.png).

>> As depicted by our plots, the random function does seem to have a fairly uniform distribution of values in our example. This is represented by the even gradient and lack of any major gaps in our PMF graph. The smooth, increasing and linear behavior of our CDF plot also shows that there is roughly an equal chance for each number to be chosen..
