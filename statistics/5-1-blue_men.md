[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

>> In this exercise, we see what percent of of the population falls between a certain range to investigate normal distributions. We are told that the heights in the United States is fairly normal with mean gaving a
mean (μ) of 178 cm and a standard deviation (σ) of 7.7 cm, and women have a mean of 163 cm with standard deviation of 7.3 cm. To be eligible to join the Blue Man Group, you must be male and between the heights of 5'10" (177.8 cm) and 6'1" (185.42 cm).

>> By calculating the CDF, we know that about 48.96% of men in the U.S. are under 5'10" and that 83.24% of men in the U.S. are under 6'1". The difference between the two CDFs is the percent of men in the U.S. who would be eligible to join the Blue Man Group: 34.27%.
